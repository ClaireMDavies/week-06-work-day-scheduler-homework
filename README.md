# Workday scheduler

## Explanation of the application <br>

To create a scheduling page that would change the colouring of each hour block depending on whether it was in the past, present or future. As well as allowing the user to input information, and for the page to retain that information when the page is refreshed. <br>


## The finished work <br>

The live site is found at [GitHubPages]: https://clairemdavies.github.io/week-06-work-day-scheduler-homework/
